# Rating Inflation on Lichess Rating

This repo contains the code and the report for the project of Data Literacy 2021/2022.

The report is [here](report/report.pdf)

Although getting and manipulating the data was the hardest part of the analysis, they are are not included in this repo because of their size. For example the csv for each month of 2019 is around 250MB, while the most recent months are close to 1GB. Instead we provide a notebook that can be used in Colab to download, process and output a csv for each month with all the necessary data from the pgn files. Note that this can take a few hours for every month in 2020 and 2021.
